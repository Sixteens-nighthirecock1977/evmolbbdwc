Just walked out of The Ballad of Wallis Island and, honestly, I'm a swirl of all kinds of feelings right now. Why didn't anyone warn me about the emotional rollercoaster I signed up for? I swear, the title made it sound like it was gonna be some peaceful little drama about an island. Nope, think again, buddy. It's like they took my expectations, dipped them in technicolor paint, and threw them at a brick wall.

I mean, the characters? Wow. They were like those odd socks you find at the bottom of the laundry basket. You know they shouldn't match, but somehow they just work together. Wallis was this mish-mash of intensity and vulnerability. One minute you'd want to give them a hug, the next you're considering moving to another seat because they might smack you with their emotions. It reminded me of trying to hug a cactus. You feel the pull but then you remember, Oh wait, that's gonna hurt.

> And then, that scene where the old guy with the hat (seriously, what was with the hats?) just starts singing out of freaking nowhere. I half expected a chorus line to appear and start dancing. My sarcasm gland was on overdrive. Some dude in the back even yelled, Get on with it! and honestly, bless him. Sometimes, you just need a hero.

The visuals, though. Wow. Looked like somebody spilled their dreams all over the screen. There was this sunset shot that made me feel like my eyeballs had grown taste buds, and they were indulging in some gourmet twilight. It's art, man. But then the next minute, Wallis is crying over a burnt toast or something equally ridiculous, and you just think, Is this some deep metaphor I'm too shallow to get?

Random thought: does that island even exist? Because googling it is on my to-do list. It felt more like a character than a place. Maybe I should just download the movie and freeze-frame it to examine those incredible ocean shots.

```csharp
bool isIslandReal = islandExists(Wallis Island);
if (!isIslandReal) { dreamOn(); }
```

Okay, I'm probably not making any sense now. But that’s kind of the point right? This film is like life. A total mess, but in an almost clever way. Not sure if I'd watch the movie again soon, but man, I walked out of there feeling something. And in a world where everything feels like fat-free yogurt, that’s something.
